Stochastic approximation of the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model of coupled oscillator system


This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for numerically investigating the Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model of
coupled oscillators and performing a stochastic approximation whereby the effects of rogue oscillators on
synchronized oscillators is approximated with a 2-dim OU process. The parameters of the 2-dim OU process 
are obtained as best fits against data from the full original system.
